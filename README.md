# qc-analysis-pipeline
Workflows used for QC of WGS or WES data

### Single Sample QC
This WDL pipeline implements QC in human whole-genome or exome/targeted sequencing data.

For more on the metrics and aggregation of metrics from multiple workflow executions, please see the [qc-metric-aggregator](https://github.com/genome/qc-metric-aggregator) repository.

#### Background

As part of the [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/) Data Processing Working Group, a Quality Control (QC) workflow was developed to harmonize and summarize the QC for all WGS and WES sequence data sets ingested and released on the AnVIL.
The figure below shows the read-level data processing and ingestion process, including decisions regarding reprocessing when data is determined to be incompatible with the Functional Equivalance standard defined in [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06159-4) Nature Communications publication.

#### Summary

The following figure shows the steps of the workflow with approximate costs of executing each step in a cloud-hosted environment.

#### Requirements/expectations
- Human paired-end sequencing data in aligned BAM or CRAM format
- Input BAM/CRAM files must additionally comply with the following requirements:
- - files must pass validation by ValidateSamFile
- - reads are provided in query-sorted order
- - all reads must have an RG tag
- Reference genome must be Hg38 with ALT contigs
- Coverage regions, either WGS or exome/targeted, must be in a compatible interval_list format

#### Outputs 
- BAM/CRAM Validation Report
- Several QC Summary Reports
- - All reads: Quality, Alignment, Insert Size, Artifact, GC Bias, Duplication, Contamination, and Coverage

### Software version requirements :
- Picard 2.21.7
- samtools 1.3.1 using htslib 1.3.1
- VerifyBamID2
- Python 2.7 and 3
- Cromwell version support 
  - Successfully tested on v48
  - Does not work on versions < v23 due to output syntax

#### RxIdentifier

For sex estimation from WGS data, methods Ry (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2013.07.004) and Rx (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163019) were compared against 1kg data. The Ry method required adjustment of the default cutoffs on the 1kg data suggesting the type of sequence data, sample source/quality, coverage levels, and/or other experimental factors may impact the estimation of sex. The Rx method required no adjustments to the default cutoffs of 0.6 and 0.8. For a more detailed comparison of Rx and Ry methods, please see: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68550-w For the Rx method, original R code is available: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163019.s003
